**Project Overview**

My final project is basically a site similar to Yelp, but instead of reviewing restaurants in general, users review the invividual dishes. This would be useful for people are more concerned what restaurant might have the best taco, for example. It would also be useful for finding hidden gems in restaurants that might not have great ratings overall, but an amazing couple of dishes that go under the radar.

**What have you done this week?**

This week I mainly just got mongoose hooked up to the MongoDB server, as well as created all of the Models for my databases. I have four models: Dish, Restaurant, Review, and User. I have my API set up right now so that I only return dishes via a GET request. I also worked on the design of what the app would look like, however didn't translate any of it into CSS.

**What do you plan on doing next week?**

I would like to set up more routes for the API, such as getting all of the reviews for a restaurant, getting all of the reviews for a specific dish, and so on. I would also like to start displaying data from my API on the frontend, as well as start roughly doing some of the styling for my site. Ideally I would also like to at a feature for the user to POST reviews for dishes. Now that I'm thinking about it, it would probably also be ideal to have the feature to be able to add new dishes to a restaurant, as well as edit what dishes there are for a restaurant. 

**What roadblocks did you encounter and what did you do to overcome them?**

This week the only block that I really encountered was time management. Unfortunately I didn't have as much time as I would have liked to work on my project, but this is partially my fault because I procrastinated a little :) Also I think it's maybe a little tricky to map out how I want the database to be layed out exactly. I feel like I'm going to be changing the properties of various databases, however since I'm using MongoDB, this shouldn't be a huge problem. It maybe would be a problem if I used an SQL database.
