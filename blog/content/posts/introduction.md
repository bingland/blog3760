**Write a little about yourself. Job, hobbies, family, interests.**

Hey everybody! My name is Brayden England, and I am from American Fork, Utah. This is my last semester of classes here at UVU, and I'm really excited to graduate. I will still have a capstone left to do in the summer, so technically I'm going to graduate in the Summer. Right now I have a job at a popcorn factory, which is a good part time job for university, but I am going to be looking for an internship pretty soon. My main hobby outside of Web Development is language learning. My target language is Russian, and I've been studying it for 2 years, however I often like to dabble in other languages as well. I can speak Russian fluently but I am nowhere near fluent in any others (besides English, of course).

**Previous Javascript Experience.**

When it comes to JavaScript, I obviously have experience like everybody else with vanilla ES6 JavaScript. When I first started learning JavaScript I also decided to learn jQuery, which seemed more popular at the time. I have experience with Node and React outside of university on my own time, and in university as well. Mainly in the past year. I have done a tiny bit of Vue for a project, however I feel like I didn't really learn how Vue works completely. 

**What things do you think you understand well?**

In terms of what I think I understand well, I feel like I'm getting a pretty good grasp as to how React works. When I was learning React, I felt really confused and often felt like I didn't know what I was doing, but that's not the case anymore. I also feel like I have a pretty good foundation on the fundamentals of Javascript, however I can definitely improve. There are so many cool things in Javascript and often times I find myself accidentally coding something inefficiently, only to realize that I could have done it a better way. I think in terms of algorithms and writing the most efficient code is where I can improve the most.

**What is your favorite part of web development?**

My favorite part of web development is bringing ideas to life onto a web page. While design isn't my area of focus, when I do design something nice and code it, it brings me a lot of satisfaction. That goes the same way for just solving a problem by programming it.

**What do you hope to learn in this class?**

In this class I hope to learn about many different and useful technologies in the wild world of web development. I look forward to learning TypeScript, as well as other front end frameworks besides React. But more experience with React will never hurt:)
