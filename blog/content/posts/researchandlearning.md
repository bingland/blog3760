**How do you personally research on the web?**

When I first started learning how to program, I would watch YouTube videos to learn everything. I actually did that way too much and I'll talk more about this when I talk about tutorial hell and what it means to me. Nowadays I do a combination of YouTube and docs, and of course Google sprinkled in thoughout the learning process when I run into any very specific questions about something, or when I run into any problems. I think I tend to use YouTube videos more when I'm learning a new technology. I think the reason why I do this is because it can be a little easy to get overwhelmed, or get lost when you're looking at documentation. What I like about YouTube videos is that they spoonfeed you the most relavant information, and get straight to the meat and potatoes of how something works. 

**What tips and tricks do you have to searching the web?**

I think being open to all types of sources of information is definitely important. Before I would be afraid of looking at the documentation for whatever reason, and this was a mistake. I also think that finding information via Google is key. You have to word things in a way that gives you the results that you want. Often times if you just describe something, that might not be good enough for Google to give you the results you wanted, and vice versa. In terms of general tutorials fow how to learn technologies, this isn't so much of a problem because there's so much out there on the internet, payed and free.

**What is "Tutorial Hell"?**

For me, Tutorial Hell is just this perpetual mindtrap where you think that the only way to learn is by watching tutorials, and also by following along while watching a tutorial. While tutorials are useful and contain a lot of great information, the only way to solidify that information into learned skills is by programming on your own. One mistake that I  made when I was learning how to program was I only watched tutorials, and never coded on my own or did my own projects. It was like a false senseof learning. The best way that we learn programming, at least for me, is by actually programming, asking questions, making mistakes, and learning off those mistakes.

**How would you recommend someone new to web development learn the skill and why?**

If they were beginners, I would recommend watching some YouTube videos to learn the basics of whatever technology interests them, however I would also strongly recommend not to cling to video tutorials too much, and to program things that interest them on their own.
