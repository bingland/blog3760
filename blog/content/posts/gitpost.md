**About Git**

Git is a very popular version control system that tracks changes between files, allows you to view that history, and allow other people to view / edit those files as well, which makes collaboration very easy. In a world without git, or without any kind of version control systems, you would have to do handoffs all the time. Imagine how annoying that would be. You would have to send that person your files, wait for them to finish doing what they need to do, then have it be returned to you, and then repeat the process over again. Having a version control system like Git makes it so you can work on something at the same time and easily collaborate with eachother. However, the place where all your files are stored along with it's git info isn't Git. This role is filled by a code hosting platfor, such as GitHub.
