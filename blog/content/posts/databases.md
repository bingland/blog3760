The biggest difference between SQL and NoSQL databases is that SQL databases are relational, and NoSQL databases are non-relational. SQL data bases tend to be vertically scalable (meaning easier to add lots of information and go through it efficiently), and NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases also use a structured query language and have a predefined schema, whereas NoSQL databases use dynamic schemas for unstructured data. 

SQL databases are a good choice for people that want pre-defined structures and schemas. It's also compatible with all major platforms, as well as being able to store a lot of information vertically. They're also great for complex quieries. SQL might not be the best choice for somebody who needs a dynamic database. NoSQL databases on the otherhand are great for people who want to focus on rapid growth with no set schema definitions; it's great if your database is constantly evolving. It's also good for performing simple queries. NoSQL might not be the best for complex heirarchies and queries.
