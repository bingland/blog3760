**What have you done this week?**
This week wasn't my most productive one because of Thanksgiving break, but I was able to make it so that the dishes of a restaurant display when you select a dish. To do this I had to make a server endpoint to GET a restaurant by its ID. I also hooked this up to the front end so that the server makes two GET requests; one when you search for a dish, and one when you click on the dish. 

**What do you plan on doing next week?**

Next week I would like to add properties to a restaurant, such as if that restaurant does takeout or not, when it's open, their website, and so on. I would also like to have a seperate page to view a restaurants information, as well as maybe a home page. I would also definitely like to be able to POST, PUT and DELETE reviews to my database. I think I'm at a point where I have the fundamental base of my site set up so now I can start adding these features.


**What roadblocks did you encounter and what did you do to overcome them?**

Time was my number one road block this week, but aside from that, I had a bit of trouble with getting the dishes for the restaurant of a selected dish to show up because I had to populate them. I felt like I was populating a ton of stuff so what I did was I made an endpoint for getting a restaurant by its ID, and this makes things easier. I think in the coming weeks I'll be adding a few more endpoints. I can see the appeal of using GraphQL in this project but I think it's too late to implement that now.
