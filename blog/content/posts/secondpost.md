Hey there! My name is Brayden England, I'm 22 years old, and I'm from American Fork, Utah. I haven't had a job or internship in the world of Web Development yet, but right now I have a job at a popcorn manufacturing company. My main interest is learning languages. I've been studying Russian for about a year and a half, and sometimes I like to dabble in other languages for fun as well. 

I have experience with ES6 JavaScript, React, and a little bit of Node.js. In University I've taken those two JavaScript courses of course, and I'd say that the main thing I've learned from them is learning how to interact with API's, and also getting better at DOM manipualtion. My favorite part of web development is the combination between design and code. I'd like to get more into full stack in the future, but it seems like everytime I try getting into Node.js or another backend langauge, I always end up stopping after a little while. However, I know that I definitely like JavaScript and React, so that's cool! In this class I'd like to gain a completely solid understanding of the fundamentals of JavaScript. Once you have a solid base of something, it's easy to build off of.
