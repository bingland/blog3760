TypeScript is a language that is built on Javascript. TypeScript is to JavaScript as SASS is to CSS; TypeScript isn't a language that can be "read" by a browser, but it's compiled into JavaScript, which the browser can read. All Javascript code works with TypeScript. What TypeScript brings to the table is the ability to type variables, as well as other full-on object-oriented features such as interfaces, classes, enums, and generics. Because of these things, TypeScript can be of great use to developers.

Having typed variables can be a gamechanger for developers because Javascript can't do this; with Javascript you can end up in situations where a variable may accidentally be a number when you wanted it to be a string. This can happen often when you're concatenating text and numbers. Another advantage that TypeScript brings to the table is that since TypeScript is compiled, you're able to check for errors right in your code editor instead of in a console. 

The difference between compilation and transpitation is that compilers take source code written in one language and outputs it to another language, whereas transpilers take source code from one language and convert it to source code in another language. I believe that TypeScript to JavaScript is an example of this, as well as Babel. An example of a compiler would be taking code written in C and converting it to binary.
