NPM stands for node package manager, and is used to share, publish, install and discover node programs. NPM allows you to track which packages you're using in a project and so every time somebody needs to install all the dependencies for your project, all you have to do is type into the terminal "npm install". If you're working on an open source project, you're able to quickly download everything you need in order to work on the project. 

NPM gives you the huge benefit of being able to easily access modules of code and use them in your projects. It also gives you the ability to create your own modules and share them with anybody. 

An NPM module is a package that you can install from NPM that you can import into your code by importing it as a module. 

The 3 main components of NPM are the website, the CLI, and the registry. The website can be used to discover and view various packages, The CLI is how you actually interact with and install / uninstall the modules, and the NPM registry is a database of packages that contain code and metadata.
