**What is the JAMStack?**

JAMStack stands for JavaScript, APIs and Markup. Sites running on JAMStack are typically built with static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, Nuxt, Next, and Gatsby. The thing that all these libraries have in common is that they don't depend on a web server. They get all the data information from the static code of the site itself, meaning you don't have to run a server, you just have to read the content once when the site builds, or from an API.

**Why is it an important tool in web development?**

JAMStack can make your site really fast. Having a big clunky backend can slow your site down and give the user a worse experience. It is also cheap, and scales well. Another advantage is higher security; when don't run a backend, and just run a static site, it reduces the chances of being attacked. 

**How can a web developer use the JAMStack?**

Well, a web developer can use the JAMStack just like we are doing. We made a blog, but JAMStack can be used in any situation where you don't need a server as your backend to gather information. 

**What tools did you use to bring up your blog?**

I used Hugo and Netlify to make my blog.

**Why did you choose those tools?**
To be honest, I initially tried to use Jekyll but I was running on to errors on my command line. So I instead decided to go with Hugo, because it seems liek I wouldn't have problems with it. I'm happy with that decision, because Hugo seems really straightforward, and I found a cool theme for my blog.
