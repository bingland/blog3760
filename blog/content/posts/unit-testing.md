Unit testing is basically breaking up your code into sections (or units, of course) and creating tests to verify that those sections of your code are working properly. Units are sections of your code that are broken up to verify that they work properly via unit testing. 

Test driven development is coding on the basis of tests. Once you write a test, you write the corresponding function that passes the test. Using a test diven development to do a project can be a great way of actually verifying that you aren't going to run into any large (or small) issues. I think we've all ran into situations where when we're coding, everything makes sense in our heads, but we end up finding little kinks in our code that can be a huge headache for us. Test driven developments can be great if you want to thoroughly iron out the wrinkles for a project as you go.

In terms of the disadvantages of a test driven development, I would imagine that it can potentially eat up valuable time depending on what you're doing and how complex it is. However it can potentially speed up the development process as well. I think it depends on the project, and how confident you are in programming it. I would also imagine that using something like TypeScript can be a very good alternative to using test driven development, because of it's ability to make coding in Javascript easier to debug without having to write a bunch of separate tests.
